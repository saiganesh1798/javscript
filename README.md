# Javscript
* Javascript is not related to java    
* After mocha name changed as livescript(1998) and after changed as java Script    
* In 1997 first java ecma standard . in 2023 latest java script version released ES13 or ES2023.    
* In interview we have to say ES5 or ES6 in our collage.    
* Framework :React,angular,view,tensorflow   we use more in world is react   ,(chatbot :tensorflow)    
* Backend in javascript :node js and express js    
* We use <script> tag for java script compiler in this we write entire program.    
**Java Script is embedded in two ways:**    
        1.write a java script program in html inside the body using script tag.    
        2.external java script file, which must be saved as ".js".
  
    **console**: console object is used to display on webpage. various method error,table,group,info,log.
      ex:console.log()  //used to dispaly messages and values of the variables.

**write a java script program to dispaly message**:        
        EX:  console.log(welcome to my website)    Link:https://onecompiler.com/javascript/43b3mtvnp

**variables**: 
    1.**Let** :we use variable in any position in code.        
       EX:https://onecompiler.com/javascript/43b3k7eva        
    2.**var**: variable can declare after we use where we declared before        
        EX: https://onecompiler.com/javascript/43b3k7eva                
    3.**Cosnt**: it is fixed         

    * let and var are mutable and const is not mutable.
    
  Note:Interview->  *  some time we assign more than one value in the variable brackets then only last value is executed:(only last value is assigned)        
                         Example: https://onecompiler.com/javascript/43b3mx6vb        
                    * we dont have to give datatype in code 
**Data Types**
In java Script we have Data Type are :     
        1.Number:
        2.String    
            ex:https://onecompiler.com/javascript/43b3nj8kz
        3.null    
        4.NaN(not a number ) :it represent invalid numbers.        
            Ex:https://onecompiler.com/javascript/43b3nnpzs    
        5.boolean-->either true or false.    
               Ex: https://onecompiler.com/javascript/43b3ns5cy        
        7.typeof--> typeof function is used to find out datatype of the variable.        
            EX:https://onecompiler.com/javascript/43b3nfdgk

**Arithematic operators** 
    +,-,*,^,/.     
    Example: https://onecompiler.com/javascript/43b3nt2qs        
**Note**: we dont write values in left side with variables we assign values at right side.            
             Ex: https://onecompiler.com/javascript/43b3pk4um

**Comparison Operators**

== // equal to   
=== // strictly equal to

        ||(OR)

        ++        
        --        
        Terenary op  ->  ? : ->> shortcut of if statement
